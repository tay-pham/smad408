    <h2>Independent Project Proposal</h2> 
    <h3>JMU Textbooks Revamp</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>I am revisiting the textbook app my team and I created in SMAD 317. It was an app that would allow JMU students to buy and sell textbooks. We conducted user research and made mockups of an app, but stopped short of actually creating a functional app or website. Though I am proud of the work that we did, there are things I wanted to improve upon, but due to time constraints had to leave as-is. I want to reevaluate and update the previously done user research and UX design/prototyping, as well as create a bootstrap site to go with the app, since we originally only designed for mobile.</p>
    <h4>Goals</h4> 
        <ul>
            <li>Revisit user research to ensure designing for an audience wider than just “normal people”, as discussed in Technically Wrong</li>
            <li>Make prototypes of more user flows and design with extra care for stress cases</li>
            <li>Learn to use prototyping tools more proficiently, specifically Adobe XD (Only Axure was used previously)</li>
            <li>Use a front end framework (Bootstrap) to create a website for the textbook app</li>
            <li>Make the website screen-reader friendly</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Audience</h4>
        <p>The broad audience was originally JMU students, but I hope to better define my audience once I begin this project. In the original project, the sample size of users we interviewed was on the smaller side, and therefore the personas created are not fully representative of the student body. Through more in depth user research, I want to empathize with students and be able to find the wants and frustrations of users to help define what actually is needed for the “average” JMU student. There is a possibility of the scope of the audience widening to just college students in general. </p>
